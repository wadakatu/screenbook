description: Link screens to Figma, Storybook, and other resources

Screenbook supports linking screens to external resources like Figma designs, Storybook components, and documentation. These links are displayed with type-specific icons in the UI.

## Link Types

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `figma` | Figma logo | Links to Figma design files |
| `storybook` | Storybook logo | Links to Storybook stories |
| `docs` | Document icon | Links to documentation |
| `other` | External link icon | Generic external links |

## Usage

Add links to your screen definition using the `links` field:

```typescript
import { defineScreen } from "screenbook"

export const screen = defineScreen({
  id: "billing.invoice.detail",
  title: "Invoice Detail",
  route: "/billing/invoices/:id",
  links: [
    {
      type: "figma",
      url: "https://www.figma.com/file/xxx/Design?node-id=123:456",
      label: "Desktop Design"
    },
    {
      type: "figma",
      url: "https://www.figma.com/file/xxx/Design?node-id=123:789",
      label: "Mobile Design"
    },
    {
      type: "storybook",
      url: "https://storybook.example.com/?path=/story/invoice-detail",
      label: "Storybook"
    },
    {
      type: "docs",
      url: "https://wiki.example.com/billing/invoice",
      label: "Wiki"
    },
  ],
})
```

## Auto-Detection

The `type` field is optional. When not specified, Screenbook automatically infers the type from the URL:

- URLs containing `figma.com` are detected as `figma`
- URLs containing `storybook` are detected as `storybook`
- Other URLs default to `other`

Note: The `docs` type cannot be auto-detected and must be explicitly specified.

```typescript
// Type is auto-detected as "figma"
links: [
  {
    url: "https://www.figma.com/file/xxx/Design",
    label: "Design"
  },
]
```

## Figma Integration

### Linking to Specific Frames

To link to a specific frame in Figma, include the `node-id` query parameter:

```typescript
links: [
  {
    type: "figma",
    url: "https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/MyDesign?node-id=1:2",
    label: "Header Component"
  },
]
```

### Multiple Designs

Many screens have multiple design variations (desktop, mobile, dark mode). Add multiple Figma links with descriptive labels:

```typescript
links: [
  {
    type: "figma",
    url: "https://www.figma.com/file/xxx?node-id=1:1",
    label: "Desktop"
  },
  {
    type: "figma",
    url: "https://www.figma.com/file/xxx?node-id=1:2",
    label: "Mobile"
  },
  {
    type: "figma",
    url: "https://www.figma.com/file/xxx?node-id=1:3",
    label: "Dark Mode"
  },
]
```

## Storybook Integration

Link screens to their corresponding Storybook stories:

```typescript
links: [
  {
    type: "storybook",
    url: "https://storybook.example.com/?path=/story/pages-invoice-detail--default",
    label: "Default Story"
  },
  {
    type: "storybook",
    url: "https://storybook.example.com/?path=/story/pages-invoice-detail--loading",
    label: "Loading State"
  },
]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive labels**: Instead of "Figma", use "Desktop Design" or "Mobile Mockup"
2. **Link to specific frames**: Use node-id to link directly to the relevant frame
3. **Keep links updated**: Remove or update links when designs change
4. **Group related links**: Multiple links of the same type should have clear, distinguishing labels
