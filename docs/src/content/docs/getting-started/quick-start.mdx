This guide will walk you through creating your first screen definition and viewing it in the Screenbook UI.

<Steps>

1. **Create a screen.meta.ts file**

   Create a `screen.meta.ts` file alongside your route/page file:

   ```ts
   // src/pages/dashboard/screen.meta.ts
   import { defineScreen } from "@screenbook/core"

   export const screen = defineScreen({
     id: "dashboard",
     title: "Dashboard",
     route: "/dashboard",
     owner: ["platform-team"],
     tags: ["core"],
   })
   ```

2. **Build the screen catalog**

   Run the build command to generate the screen metadata:

   ```bash
   npx screenbook build
   ```

   This creates:
   - `.screenbook/screens.json` - All screen metadata
   - `.screenbook/graph.mmd` - Navigation graph in Mermaid format
   - `.screenbook/coverage.json` - Coverage statistics

3. **Start the development server**

   View your screens in the Screenbook UI:

   ```bash
   npx screenbook dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) to see your screen catalog.

4. **Add navigation relationships**

   Define how screens connect to each other:

   ```ts
   // src/pages/dashboard/screen.meta.ts
   export const screen = defineScreen({
     id: "dashboard",
     title: "Dashboard",
     route: "/dashboard",
     owner: ["platform-team"],
     tags: ["core"],
     next: ["settings", "profile"],  // Screens this page links to
   })
   ```

   ```ts
   // src/pages/settings/screen.meta.ts
   export const screen = defineScreen({
     id: "settings",
     title: "Settings",
     route: "/settings",
     owner: ["platform-team"],
     tags: ["core"],
     entryPoints: ["dashboard"],  // Screens that link here
   })
   ```

5. **View the navigation graph**

   Rebuild and refresh the UI to see the navigation graph:

   ```bash
   npx screenbook build
   npx screenbook dev
   ```

   Navigate to the Graph view to see how your screens connect.

</Steps>

## Auto-generate screen.meta.ts files

If you have many routes, you can auto-generate screen.meta.ts files:

```bash
npx screenbook generate
```

This scans your route files and creates skeleton screen.meta.ts files that you can customize.
